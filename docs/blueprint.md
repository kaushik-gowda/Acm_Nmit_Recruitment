- Background color: Very light gray (#F0F0F0) for a clean, modern look.
- Accent color: A slightly brighter, contrasting blue (#0077CC) to highlight call-to-action buttons and key information.
- Font pairing: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text to ensure readability, combined with 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headings for a modern and tech-inspired feel.
- Use simple, outlined icons from a consistent icon set, in ACM Blue, to represent benefits, activities, and contact methods.
- Employ a grid-based layout with clear sections to organize information logically, and use cards to highlight specific details or benefits.
- Implement subtle fade-in effects on scroll, and smooth hover animations on interactive elements (buttons, cards) to enhance user experience without being distracting.
